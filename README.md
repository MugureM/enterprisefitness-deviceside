============================

This project includes the Host-side Android and Wearable-side Tizen components of an integrated Samsung Gear 2 application. Pedometer statistics collected using the windows motion web api (steps taken, distance travelled, calories burned) are sent to the host using the Samsung Accessory SDK and then sent to Azure Event Hubs for distribution and processing.
